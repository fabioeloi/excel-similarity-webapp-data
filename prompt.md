create a webapp plan for an app where the user upload an excel file with 2 columns, the first one with a list of items to be search, the second one with a list of items where the ones on the first column could be located. Here's the catch: both columns can contain very disjointed and error prone items. The goal is to make a similarity search using machine learning algorithms (maybe sklearn) in order to do a vectorized search, return a file with a third column of located itens, and a fourth column with the percentage of similarity achieved in the third column item found. That said, the application must be build DDD, TDD, CI/CD on Github from the very start, with backend in python and frontend in javascript. Use the most common web and data frameworks. Don't over engineer.
